##the iconic font designed for Bootstrap

The full suite of pictographic icons, examples, documentation, and full license details can be found at:

##Building

Font Awesome requires node.js and a globally installed grunt.js to compile the LESS styles and minify the CSS. For installation
instructions on how to install node.js see http://nodejs.org/download/

Installing grunt.js

```
  npm install -g grunt
```

Installing the build tasks

```
  npm install
```

Build the CSS

```
  grunt build
```

This will compile the LESS styles and create a minified version of it. Additionally it creates a font-awesome.zip file with all files needed.
