  <h2 class="page-header">Need IE7 Support?</h2>
  <p>
    If you need IE7 support, you have my condolences. Really. Font Awesome {{ site.fontawesome.version }}
    doesn't support IE7, but an older version does. You'll need to check out the
    <a href="{{ page.relative_path }}3.2.1/get-started/#need-ie7">3.2.1 instructions for using IE7</a>. Then go complain to
    whomever decided your project needs IE7 support.
