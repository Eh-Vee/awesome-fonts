  <p>
    IE8 has some issues with <code>@font-face</code> when combined with <code>:before</code>.
    Font Awesome uses that combination. If a page is cached, and loaded without the mouse over the window
    (i.e. hit the refresh button or load something in an iframe) then the page gets rendered before the font loads.
    Hovering over the page (body) will show some of the icons and hovering over the remaining icons will show those as well.
